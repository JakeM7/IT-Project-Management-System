<h3>Description about project</h3>

<p>This application receives a list of projects and allows an administrator to assign employees to a project.  The administrator then can modify the progress of the project to update the tracking of the project.  Users can view the progress of projects but they cannot edit the progress or add employees to a project.</p>
